# Memory Management in GO

Memory allocation and Deallocation happen automatically 

we will be using two methods 

1. new()

  - Allocate memory but no INIT
  - you will get a memory address
  - zeroed storage

2. make()

  - Allocate memory and INIT
  - you will get a memory address
  - non zeroed storage
